## Summary

This proposal adds a new well-known label `service.kubernetes.io/endpoint-controller-name` to Kubernetes Services. This label disables the default Kubernetes EndpointSlice controller and delegates the control of EndpointSlices to a custom EndpointSlice controller.

Additionally, this KEP aims to give more flexibility for the EndpointSlice Reconciler package to allow users to select the way the pods should be converted into endpoints.

## Motivation

As of now, a service can be delegated to a custom service proxy if the label `service.kubernetes.io/service-proxy-name` is set. Introduced in [KEP-2447](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2447), this allows custom service proxies to implement service in different ways to address different purpose / use-cases. However, the EndpointSlices attached to this service will still be reconciled in the same way as any other services. Addressing more purpose / use-cases, for example, different pod IP addresses, is therefore not natively possible.

Delegating EndpointSlice control would allow custom controllers to define their own criterias for pod availability, selecting different pod IPs than the pod.status.PodIPs and more. As reference implementation, and since [KEP-3685](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3685), the reconciler logic used by Kubernetes can be reused by custom EndpointSlice controllers. 

### Goals

* Disable the EndpointSlice controller for services that hold the label `service.kubernetes.io/endpoint-controller-name`.
* Expose the convertion of Pods to an Endpoints from the Kubernetes EndpointSlice Reconciler.

### Non-Goals

* Change / Replace / Deprecate the existing behavior of the Kubernetes EndpointSlice controller.
* Implement new EndpointSlice controllers as part of Kubernetes.
* Modify the Service / EndpointSlice Specs.

## Proposal

#### Well-Known Label

`service.kubernetes.io/endpoint-controller-name` will be added as a well-known label applying on the Service object. When set on a service, the Endpoint, EndpointSlice, and EndpointSliceMirroring for that service will be disabled, thus, Endpoints and EndpointSlices for this service will not be created by the Kubernetes Controller Manager. 

#### Flexibility on the EndpointSlice Reconciler Package

The `Reconciler` will hold a reference to a function implementing the function type described below to allow users to implement their own version of PodToEndpoint. 

```golang
type PodToEndpoint func(pod *v1.Pod, node *v1.Node, service *v1.Service, addressType discovery.AddressType) discovery.Endpoint
```

The current `podToEndpoint`, implemented here: [endpointslice/utils.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/endpointslice/blob/v0.30.2/utils.go#L37), could be made public, so the Kubernetes EndpointSlice would use it and continue to work with the same behavior as today.

Currently used here: [endpointslice/reconciler.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/endpointslice/blob/v0.30.2/reconciler.go#L208), this function converts the pod to an endpoint by setting the TargetRef, pod readiness, PodIPs...


### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a Cloud Native Network Function (CNF) vendor, some of my services are handled by custom service-proxies over secondary networks provided by, for example, [Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni). IPs configured in the service and registered by the EndpointSlice controller must be only the secondary IPs provided by the secondary network provider (e.g. [Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni), also see [KEP-3698](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3698)).

Therefore, it must be possible to disable the default Kubernetes EndpointSlice Controller for certain services and re-use the EndpointSlice controller implementation with custom functions converting pods to endpoints.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

N/A

### Risks and Mitigations

The existing behavior will be kept by default, and the Kubernetes EndpointSlice Controller will be disabled only when the service contains this new label. This ensures services without the label to continue to be managed as usual.

This will have no effect on other EndpointSlice controller implementations since they will not be influenced by the presence of this label.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

/

##### Integration tests

/

##### e2e tests

- Usage of `service.kubernetes.io/endpoint-controller-name` on services
    * A service is created with the label and the service has then no endpoints.
    * A service is created without the label, the service has endpoints. Then service is updated with the label and the service has no longer any endpoints.

## Alternatives

### Use Annotation as Selector

Services without selectors will not get any EndpointSlice objects. Therefore, selecting pods can be done in different ways, for example, via annotation. An annotation will be used in the service to select which pods will be used as backend for this service. For example, [nokia/danm](https://github.com/nokia/danm) uses `danm.k8s.io/selector` (e.g. [DANM service declaration](https://github.com/nokia/danm/blob/v4.3.0/example/svcwatcher_demo/services/internal_lb_svc.yaml#L7)), and [projectcalico/vpp-dataplane](https://github.com/projectcalico/vpp-dataplane) uses `extensions.projectcalico.org/selector` (e.g. [Calico-VPP Multinet services](https://github.com/projectcalico/vpp-dataplane/blob/v3.25.1/docs/multinet.md#multinet-services)). To simplify the user experience, a mutating webhook could read the selector, add them to the annotation and clear them from the specs when the type of service is detected.

The custom EndpointSlice Controller will then read the annotation to select the pods targeted by the service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service
  annotations:
    selector: "app=a"
spec: {}
```

### Use Dummy Selector

The set of Pods targeted by a Service is determined by a selector, the labels in the selector must be included as part of the pod labels. If a dummy selector is added to the service, Kubernetes will not select any pod, the endpointslices created by Kubernetes will then be empty. To simplify the user experience, a mutating webhook could add the dummy selector when the type of service is detected.

The custom EndpointSlice Controller could read the service.spec.selector and ignore the dummy label to select pods targeted by the service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service
spec:
  selector:
    app: a
    dummy-selector: "true"
```
